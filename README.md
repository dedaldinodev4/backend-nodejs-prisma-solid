# Backend with Nodejs + Prisma + Typescript + S.O.L.I.D + TDD


Software testing is a way to assess application 
quality and reduce the risk of failure in operation.
Test Driven Development (TDD) is a process used before or during the development 
of new software. Its objective is to carry out a cycle of repetitions, 
while the developer writes automated tests to validate requirements, implement new functionalities, among other objectives.

## Tests

There are 3 types of tests most used
* Unitary tests.
* Integration tests.
* End-to-End Testing (E2E)

### Unitary Tests

Unit testing consists of verifying the behavior of the 
smallest units in your application.
